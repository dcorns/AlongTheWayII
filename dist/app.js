 *
 * @fileoverview The RouteBoxer class takes a path, such as the Polyline for a
 * route generated by a Directions request, and generates a set of LatLngBounds
 * objects that are guaranteed to contain every point within a given distance
 * of that route. These LatLngBounds objects can then be used to generate
 * requests to spatial search services that support bounds filtering (such as
 * the Google Maps Data API) in order to implement search along a route.
 * <br/><br/>
 * RouteBoxer overlays a grid of the specified size on the route, identifies
 * every grid cell that the route passes through, and generates a set of bounds
 * that cover all of these cells, and their nearest neighbours. Consequently
 * the bounds returned will extend up to ~3x the specified distance from the
 * route in places.
